"full_slugs2_and_2_1_with_all_library_pads" contains the full zipped project, library, and padstacks. It contains more files than necessary because I don't want to miss anything. It should work fine.

"board_gerber_files" has the files you need to submit to a board house. It also has some screen shots I made while test-submitting to Sierra Proto Express No-Touch.

"PDFs" has the schematics in PDF form, duh

"link_board" is an Altium Designer 09 project containing schematics for the link board. This board sits between the Xtend radio and the groundstation laptop and acts as a go-between.

Enjoy!
